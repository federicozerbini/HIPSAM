Higher Polylogarithms and String Amplitudes


In this interdisciplinary project we will describe the mathematical structure of superstring amplitudes in genus one and two, generalizing recent beautiful progress made at genus zero. This will enable us to present original ideas for advancing in the study of higher-genus polylogarithms, and at the same time to obtain new information on string theory predictions for fundamental interactions. The results obtained will point towards new directions in many fields of mathematics, such as mixed motives and moduli spaces of curves, opening new research gates completely inspired by physics. Moreover, the techniques developed will allow to attack similar nowadays intractable computations of amplitudes in quantum field theory, which can be compared with the experimental data produced by particle accelerators.
